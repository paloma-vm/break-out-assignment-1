## Getting started - how to run the project
To run the project, open index.html with live server

## Tools and technologies used
HTML, JS, ESLint, Node, npm, yarn, TypeScript

linting, classes, bundling

I started with the tutorial, then made classes for all the main components of the game.  Along the way I used ESLint to follow best practices according to Airbnb's standards.  

Then I bundled the game to condense it and then converted it to typescript.
